  Data Analysis with IPL data will teach Python programming in a fun way using IPL
  dataset.
  
  I used to play cricket a lot in my childhood. I was very much interested in the numbers of cricket like runrate during the
  powerplay and average score of toporder batsmen, but I didn't have access to data that time. Now we have access to data and
  technology which allow us to explore all these details.
  
  In this course we will learn how to load the data and explore the data to find out valuable insights of it.
